Strucure:

N. Section => Summary, [so] purpose of this section
  - detail 1
  - detail 2

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

0. Intro, About us, Outline of the talk, etc.

1. What is Travis? => Show what it does, so people get a basic clue.

  - Josh (?) does this:

    - Get someone up on stage who has a repository that is not on travis-ci but that has a Gemfile.
    - On a second notebook check the repository briefly and maybe make a quick correction to it (like add rake to the Gemfile).
    - Then connect this notebook to the screen.
    - Tell him to sign up with Github and hook up the repo.
    - Tell him to go to the Github admin page and run the tests.
    - Thanks. Reconnect the main notebook if necessary.

  - Meanwhile Sven (?) introduces Travis:

    - Travis is an open source CI solution for the Ruby community on the Web.
    - Brief history (would make sense, but is there enough time? is it worth it at all?)
    - Show the Travis UI and briefly click through it.

  - Conclusion: So, Travis CI is a continuous integration service on the web that you can use to run your tests effortlessly.

2. Why Travis? => Explain how it is different from others, so people understand the purpose.

  - We're obviously not alone. List others. (CruiseControl, Jenkins, CIJoe, Integrity, Big Tuna ..., Railsonfire?)
  - We don't just want to write another piece of software. We want to make the world a better place!
  - List aspects (Ruby, Open API, Distributed, Community, Instant, Simple)
  - Vision: Become for builds what Gemcutter is for gems.

3. State of Travis => List achievements and awesomeness, so people understand it already rocks.

  - Some statistics (lots of shit already)
  - Who's testing? (RSpec, Cucumber, Devise, ...)
  - Github loves us and changed their API
  - Rails loves us and wants to test on Travis
  - Rubinius loves us and helps fixing bleeding edge rbx preview installs
  - People are throwing boxes at us. We can't even use as many servers as people want to give to us!

4. Architecture => Explain how it is done, so people understand it's not that hard (and they can join)

  - show how Travis works (Github => App => Worker => App => Clients)

5. Things we have learned => ???, not sure what the purpose of this section is, actually i'm not sure about the whole section

  - Manage expectations vs doability
  - LC_ALL

6. The Future => Explain what we have on the list, so people get eager to jump in and help

  - Connect loose ends of the Ruby community infrastructure (isitruby19, ... what else?)
  - Eager tests for important Gems triggered by Ruby (Rubinius, ...) releases
  - Integrate with Github more tightly (pre-tested pull-requests)
  - Build more clients (desktop toolbar app, mobile clients)
  - Build on other architectures (Macruby, ...)

7. Join us! => Explain how people can join us, so they'll do it :)


98. Who's awesome? You're awesome!
99. Questions?

  - Have the Travis naming question prepared in case people need a while.
